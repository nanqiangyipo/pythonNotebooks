      " |  \n",

      " |  which can be a `Tensor` of any type and shape. The initial value defines the\n",

      " |  the variable are fixed. The value can be changed using one of the assign\n",
      " |  methods.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  If you want to change the shape of a variable later you have to use an\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  Just like any `Tensor`, variables created with `Variable()` can be used as\n",
      " |  inputs for other Ops in the graph. Additionally, all the operators\n",
      " |  overloaded for the `Tensor` class are carried over to variables, so you can\n",
      " |  also add nodes to the graph by just doing arithmetic on variables.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  import tensorflow as tf\n",
      " |  \n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  The most common initialization pattern is to use the convenience function\n",
      " |  `initialize_all_variables()` to add an Op to the graph that initializes\n",
